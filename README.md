This project serves to function as a web-based calculator that is capable of:
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division

This should have some of the comforts of a typical calculator as well, such as the use of backspace to remove numbers and only allowing one decimal point to be present for each number. A clear button is also present to erase the current operation that is in progress.
